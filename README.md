 ## A Personal Audiovisual logo for C2HO
 
 MCTeam's contribution to this hackathon is an audio visual logo for C2HO, personalized by fetching the IP adress and name of the user. <br>
 C2HO is a network, and to symbolize the network we used the old dial up tone from the days of the dial up modems. Audio is generated that dials up the users IP adress, while the visual logo starts to build on screen. In the end a voice message welcomes the user by their name, or at least the name of the owner of the computer who is used when logging on.
